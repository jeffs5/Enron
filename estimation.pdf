To find this term, we had actually done part of the developer section, but
weren't able to finish it due to memory issues. We were able to run it for about 50,000 files,
and ran it for 40,000, 30,000, 20,000, and 10,000 and used excel to find an equation to
find it for larger numbers of files.

Like we mentioned above, we used the file we were able to create for the 50,000 files, and
multiplied it by ten to get a file size that's representative of 520,000 files.
