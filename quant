How many people are targeted in the data set?
150 

How many files are we dealing with?
520,926

How many messages were sent by these people in total? 
126072
We defined a message as being sent if it was found within a folder
with the word 'sent' in it. We assumed that the mail client or the user
properly divided messages that were sent and the folders of this assignment
were created based on this mail client/user structure.

How many messages were sitting in these people's inboxes in total?
41639
We defined a message as being in the person's inbox if it was found within 
their inbox folder. We assumed that the mail client properly divided messages 
that were received and the folders of this assignment were created based on 
this mail client structure. We also ignored folders titled notes_inbox and 
old_inbox based on the assumption that users created these extra groups/folders 
to organize their mail and that these were technically not apart of the person's inbox.
